# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS.

1. Clone the repo onto a subdirectory of your base Apache server directory.
2. Install XAMPP in your system. You can download and install it from the links given at the end of this file.
Make the Apache and MySQL run using the XAMPP control panel.  
3. Make sure you also hav Laravel 5 installed. After the installation, create a new project names spiderquiz and the necesaary files will be automatically created in the folder directory.. 
4. Edit the config.php file. Write in your Username , password and database name. Also change the same in database.php and .env file.
5. Create a databse called quiz and your database tables will be created automaically once you run the localhost/quiz/public/  link. Because i hav given the create table Sql commands in the welcome.blade.php file.
6. All the external bootstrap modules are given in the public directory.  Download the modules from the following links to enable the loading function. http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css , https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js , http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js . 
7. So after folowing all these instructions , just play around running the localhost/quiz/public/ link. Have fun and enjoy the quiz interface. Cheers. 

# PROCESS HOW IT GOES ABOUT.

1. Initially when is request to the link localhost/spiderquiz/public/ is requested , the page will welcome you with a loading function. It will then show us the welcome page. It contains all the quiz instructions and its key features. It also conatins the registration and the login input fields.
2. An already registered user can enter the credientials in the login input fields and then proceed to the home page of the quiz.
3. A new comer to the quiz can enter the registration details through the input fields.
4. Once you enter the home page of the quiz , the user has two options. He can either submit questions by entering the question and their options in the input fields.
5. A user can answer all the unanswered questions and his score will be updated automatically.  The user can view his score at any point of time. There will be a pie chart depicting the score.
6. The user can also hav a look at the leaderboard which is depicted in tables using bootstrap. Have fun.
